                            18.1. Arbitration Procedures. You and Century agree that, except as provided in Section 18.4 below,
                            all disputes, controversies, and claims related to this Agreement (each a “Claim”), will be finally
                            and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a
                            written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party
                            will be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined
                            Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated
                            (the “JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. In the event of a conflict

                            18.2. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 18.4 below, You may seek any non-injunctive remedies
                            available to You under state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration,
                            both You and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is
                            relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision
                            regarding the Claim, the award given, and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the
                            arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration will
                            be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator.
                            Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) You and Century may litigate in court to compel
                            arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on
                            the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision will be final, binding on
